                    <p> <span>-HISTORY OF PHILIPPINE CINEMA</span> The youngest of the Philippine arts,<br> film has evolved to become the most popular of all the art forms. Introduced<br>only in 1897, films have ranged from silent movies to talkies; black and white<br> to color. Outpacing its predecessoqrs by gaining public acceptance, from one<br> end of the country to the other, its viewers come from all walks of life. Nationwide,<br>there are more than 1000 movie theaters. Early in the 1980s, it was estimated<br>in Metro Manila alone, there were around 2.5 million moviegoers. As an art form,<br>it reflects the culture and the beliefs of the people it caters to and most times, is the<br> one who shapes their consciousness.</p>

                    <p> -<span>Cinema of the Philippines</span> (Filipino: Pelikulang Pilipino or Sine Pilipino) began with the introduction of the first moving pictures to the country on August 31, 1897, at the Salón de Pertierra in Manila. The following year, local scenes were shot on film for the first time by a Spaniard, Antonio Ramos, using the Lumiere Cinematograph. While most early filmmakers and producers in the country were mostly wealthy enterprising foreigners and expatriates, on September 12, 1919, Dalagang Bukid (Country Maiden), a movie based on a popular musical play, was the first movie made and shown by Filipino filmmaker José Nepomuceno. Dubbed as the "Father of Philippine Cinema," his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines.</p>
